This is portfolio was with the help of Massively and Initio, a free, multipurpose, text-heavy, 
article-oriented design built around a huge background image (with a new parallax implementation 
I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the 
one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one that fulfills a few user requests and makes use 
of some new techniques I've been wanting to try out. Enjoy it :)
